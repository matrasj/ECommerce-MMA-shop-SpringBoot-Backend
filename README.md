# ECommerce-MMA-shop-SpringBoot-Backend

Main goal of ECommerce-MMA-shop was to create full-stack ecommerce. This repo contains backend side written in Java. For authentication I implemented role based JWT authentication. Data are being stored in MySQL database. For sending email I used MAILDEV hosted on docker container.
Moreover for payments I used Stripe API payments. Screenshots of frontned side are available under this link https://github.com/pozerinhooo/ECommerce-MMA-shop-Angular-FrontEnd

# IMPORTANT NOTE
All images, prudct descripitons, prices etc. are taken form real polish ecommerce store MMA Maniak: https://mmaniak.pl/ 
Goal of project was educational to learn Agnular, I don't use this data in purpose of selling real products.
